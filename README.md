## Configuration

Despite facing challenges, our team successfully fulfilled the primary project requirements and went above and beyond by incorporating additional features, including:

- Loyalty Program: We implemented a loyalty program designed to incentivize customers to choose our store regularly. This program includes a reward system where customers earn points for their transactions. These points unlock various benefits, creating a more engaging and rewarding shopping experience.
  
- Special Product Offers: In addition to the core functionality, we introduced special offers on specific products. This feature allows us to dynamically adjust prices, run limited-time promotions, and provide personalized discounts. 
These extra features not only meet the project's objectives but also contribute to a more competitive and customer-centric application. We believe these additions will positively impact user engagement, loyalty, and overall satisfaction with our platform.
